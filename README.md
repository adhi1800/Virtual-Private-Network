# Virtual-Private-Network

## VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes a secure, encrypted connection over a public network like the internet, protecting your online privacy and security. It creates a "tunnel" for your internet traffic, masking your real IP address and hiding your browsing activity from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and others, while also allowing you to bypass geographic restrictions.

## How a VPN works???

![](https://assets.bytebytego.com/diagrams/0052-how-a-vpn-works.png)

A VPN works by creating an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server. Here's the process simplified:

1. **Connection Establishment**: When you activate a VPN on your device, it connects to a server operated by the VPN provider.
2. **Encryption**: The VPN encrypts your data (information, files, web traffic) so that it’s unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it, whether it's a hacker on the same Wi-Fi network or an entity trying to monitor your browsing.
3. **Traffic Redirection**: Your device’s internet traffic is routed through the VPN server, which can be located in any country. This makes it appear as though you’re browsing from the server’s location, masking your actual IP address.
4. Decryption: Once your data reaches the VPN server, it is decrypted and sent to the destination (such as a website, app, or service). Any response from the server is then sent back to you through the encrypted tunnel.
